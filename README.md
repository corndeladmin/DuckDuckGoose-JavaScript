## Running
Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
Build the app:
```shell
npm run build
```
Run the app:
```shell
npm run start
```

The `build` script uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle `src/app.ts` and its dependencies into
`dist/app.js`. It also copies over the static and template files.
